# 👋 Hi there — I'm a Credit Union Executive & Tech Advocate

Welcome! I'm a passionate credit union executive with deep roots in lending, operations, technology, and management. My mission? To help credit unions grow by embracing open-source technology, powerful programming, and emerging AI solutions.

## 🚀 Vision

Credit unions deserve access to the same powerful tools as big banks — and I believe we can get there together.

Through **collaboration**, **education**, and **open-source development**, I aim to help credit unions thrive in a fast-changing digital world. We can build smarter systems, more intuitive member experiences, and better internal tools — without breaking the budget.

> 💡 *With the right vision and a willingness to share, credit unions can compete with anyone.*

## 🤖 Why I'm Excited About LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a game-changer. I believe they will:

- Drastically lower the barrier to programming by removing syntax roadblocks
- Empower business users to *think like developers*
- Bridge the gap between idea and implementation
- Let credit unions build faster, safer, and more personalized tools for members

> 🌐 *It's not just about what tech can do — it's about how we apply it securely, responsibly, and creatively.*
